CODE BOOK

This Code Book provides a data dictionary of the variables in the included dataset.


VARIABLES
=========

Subject
-- This is the person who performed the activity for each window sample.  Its range is from 1 to 30.

Activity
-- The activities performed by the Subjects.  Activities include: walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and laying

Data Variables
-- This section provides a key understanding terms in the data variables.  A list of all the data variables included follows the key.

DATA VARIABLES
=====================

KEY TO THE DATA VARIALBLE

t           time (in seconds)

Acc         acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer

-X/-Y/-Z    axis in standard gravity units 'g'. 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ

Gyro        gyroscope

Jerk        Jerk signal derived in time from the body linear acceleration and angular velocity

Mag         Magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm

mean()      mean (average) of the observations made

std()       standard deviation of the observations made
